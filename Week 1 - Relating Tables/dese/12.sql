/*A parent asks you for advice on finding the best
public school districts in Massachusetts.
In 12.sql, write a SQL query to find public school
districts with above-average per-pupil expenditures
and an above-average percentage of teachers rated
“exemplary”. Your query should return the districts’
names, along with their per-pupil expenditures and
percentage of teachers rated exemplary. Sort the
results first by the percentage of teachers rated
exemplary (high to low), then by the per-pupil
expenditure (high to low).*/
